## Prerequisites 
The repository requires classic python libraries to be installed, namely: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `sklearn`. 

Then you can simply clone the repository and start using it. 

## Content
The repository comprises of:

- `summary.pdf` : presents a brief summary of the paper as well as the main experimental results 
- `experiments` : includes :
    - `experiments.ipynb` a notebook that showcases the algorithm developed for some examples of Gaussian mixture distributions
    - `src` folder that contains the code files :
        - `utils.py` comprising useful functions
        - `VariationalGaussianMixture.py` implements the main class __VariationalGaussianMixture__ used to build the variationa Bayesian model.
